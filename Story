He was walking on the street when he suddenly noticed lights flickering....

*3 hours ago

Nick had woken up in the evening after having a long and comfortable sleep in the afternoon. He was going
out to meet up with his friends but on his way there he felt very strange pull, he suddenly started 
walking the other way but he didn't know why. He was running until he was in an open field and he 
suddenly realised he was in the middle of nowhere and lost. He tried to find his way back but couldn't so he
waited there for about 15 minutes until his body felt another jolt, it was pulling him again back to 
the place whe originally was.

He didn't realise anything until he saw a bright light in the sky, getting bigger and bigger as time 
passed. He thought it was some celestial body glowing normally but later his jaw dropped as he saw that
a giant meteor was headed straight for him. He gasped and started running blindly, anywhere where he 
thought the wind came from. He couldn't think very much as he knew either the humans were going to cease
to exist and he was going to be the first of them. With the wind rushing through his flowy hair, he saw a 
light. He ran as fast as he could but it was no use, the meteor had gotten too close and then he just 
fell to his knees, awaiting to be crushed under a giant piece of space rock.
